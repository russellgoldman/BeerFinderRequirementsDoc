                Our application will be web based. It will require that a user will have the ability to use a computer, connect to the internet (Wi-Fi or wired ethernet connections), and use a web browser to navigate through our application site.

              </h4>
              <p>
                This section describes the software requirements for the BeerBuddy application. The purpose of our application will be to make (preferred) beer acquisition easier and faster. The application aims to increase the speed of the buying process. Presently, customers go through a six-step process when purchasing anything. In order; problem recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision, purchase and post purchase evaluation. Essentially the problems a consumer faces are; they don’t know what they want, they must work and evaluate choices (costly endeavor) and finally they are left to review themselves whether they like the products/services they purchased. Our web application will allow users to use essential primary criteria to make choices that will best suit their preferences. Since the consumer already has a historic previous preference they will be able to make the choices that will offer them relevant options to choose from instead of testing out every product to determine if they enjoy it or not.

                Ease of Use
              </h4>
              <p>
                This section describes the consumer view for the BeerBuddy application. Initially the user will have the main screen with two options. An option where they choose whether they are familiar with beers, the experience option,  or they are novice beer consumers, the novice option. Choosing the experienced option will then lead to a new page that will be selection criteria. After the user chooses their preferences, the application will generate a list of relevant beers. The user will then be able to select the beer they would like based on the entered preferences. The latter option of novice consumers will lead to a page which will have approximately five to ten beers which are extremely different. The user will be able to select the one that interests them, the application will list the qualities or key characteristics of the drink and any relevant reviews. For all the drinks the assumption will be made that they are available for purchase locally (for this project local is assumed to be Waterloo Region).

                Scalability
              </h4>
              <p>
                This section describes the scalability for the BeerBuddy application. Initially, the application is designed to be accessible via websites. As a business model, this application would ideally made for tablets which would be available at local bars, pubs, and nightclubs. This would make it easier for people to pick out new drinks or similar drinks to try. If implemented in tablet mode, the application could also be used in local beer stores or stores with an assortment of beers/alcohols that are available for purchase. This would increase the stores revenue and the data can then be recorded and sold to beer/alcohol manufacturers so that they can monitor what the consumers like to drink. More generally the algorithm could also be applied to other products to determine brand/quality preferences.

              <p>
                The goal of BeerBuddy is to provide insight and advice in beer choices of its users. They can enter criteria that they want to use to query related beers, as well as adding custom beers to the database (would involve use of API). The service assumes that the beers are available locally (same city as one resides in).

              <p>
                Incase preferred beer is not found, or user has already tried all the listed suggested beers. A window is available (through an “Add New Beer” button) for the user to enter a new beer that fits the selection criteria previously listed (if not selected the user will enter attributes on their own). The user needs to have an active account in order to be able to add the beer to the database.
